# Pdex
# README
By downloading the .css, .html and the .js file will give you full access to the files. First you have to 
run the jekyll.yml on the github actions section. This repository will take the PokeAPI, and use it to 
showcase every pokemon, show the typing, the height, the weight and index number. The pokemon will appear
on the screen with a forward and backwards image. The API has been accessed using the FETCH function. 
This pokedex is meant to show every single pokemon that has been created. The HTML and CSS have been validated
however the validation will be placed in another file.
